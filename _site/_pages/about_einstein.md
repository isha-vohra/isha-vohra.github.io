## About Me

Hello! My name is Isha Vohra, and I'm a Computer Science Major with concentration in Intelligence and People at Georgia Tech graduating in December 2023. I will be starting my Master's in CS with a concentration in Machine Learning at Georgia Tech in January 2024 and am expected to graduate by December 2024.

On campus, I am involved in Girls Who Code, Women's Recruitment Team, and I am a Grand Challenges LLC alum. Last semester, I was a Startup Lab (CS 2701) TA and am currently a TA for CS 3510- Design and Analysis of Algorithms. I have interned at Salesforce as a Client Platform Engineering Intern in Summer 2023 and at Northwestern Mutual as a Software Engineering Intern in Summer 2022. I enjoy full stack engineering roles that allow me to interface with multiple types of tools.

In my free time, I enjoy cooking and trying new foods, writing, playing the guitar, and reading about random things (and going down rabbit holes, discovering and learning new topics!)
